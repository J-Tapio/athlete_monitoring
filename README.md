# Athlete Monitoring - Rehabilitation - Physiotherapy

## About Project

Goal is to transfer most often used questionnaires into usable React components one by one. Mostly will include questionnaires, which I have found to be useful and/or used within studies.

Started project with a wellness questionnaire by *McLean et al. (2010)* which is suitable for athlete monitoring before training session to collect data about athlete readiness and current body areas of concern (injury, pain).

Possibly will add few more sports related questionnaires and move on to add validated Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation related questionnaires.

Issue with questionnaires is always the feasibility to use in other language other than the original language the questionnaire was created and studied.

Translating quetionnaires to other languages is always a difficult task and more often translation of questionnaire(s) should be studied and validated to make sure that translation is feasible within the cultural context where used.

If there are fellow developers with Sports & Physiotherapy background who would like to contribute and collaborate to take this project further, please reach me out :smile:
