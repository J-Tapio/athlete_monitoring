# Athlete Monitoring / Rehabilitation / Physiotherapy

## About Project

Transferring most often used questionnaires into usable React components one by one. Mostly will include questionnaires, which I have found to be useful / used within studies.

Starting project with wellness questionnaire which is suitable for athlete monitoring before training session to collect data about athlete readiness and current body areas of concern (injury, pain).

Possibly will add few more sports related questionnaires and move on to add validated Physiotherapy / Rehabilitation related questionnaires.

Issue with questionnaires is always the feasibility to use in other language other than the original language the questionnaire was created.

Translating quetionnaires to other languages is always a difficult task and more often translation of questionnaire(s) should be studied/validated to make sure that translation is feasible within the cultural context where used.
